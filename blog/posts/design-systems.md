# Building Modern Design Systems

Design systems are the foundation of consistent, scalable user interfaces. In this post, I explore the key principles behind effective design systems.

## Core Principles

1. **Consistency** - Unified visual language across all touchpoints
2. **Scalability** - Components that grow with your application
3. **Accessibility** - Inclusive design from the ground up

## Implementation Tips

When building a design system, start with the fundamentals: color, typography, and spacing. These three pillars will guide every component you create.

```css
:root {
  --primary: #9bcf00;
  --spacing-unit: 4px;
  --font-primary: 'Inter', sans-serif;
}
```

The key is maintaining flexibility while enforcing consistency. Your system should empower designers and developers, not constrain them.
