# Web Performance Optimization Strategies

Performance is not just a technical concernâ€”it's a user experience imperative. Every millisecond counts.

## Key Metrics

- **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint): < 2.5s
- **FID** (First Input Delay): < 100ms
- **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift): < 0.1

## Optimization Techniques

### 1. Asset Optimization

Compress images, minify code, and leverage modern formats like WebP and AVIF.

### 2. Critical CSS

Inline critical styles and defer non-essential CSS to improve initial render time.

### 3. Code Splitting

Split JavaScript bundles to load only what's needed for each route.

```javascript
// Dynamic imports for code splitting
const component = await import('./HeavyComponent.js');
```

## Results Matter

Faster sites lead to better engagement, higher conversion rates, and improved SEO rankings. Make performance a priority from day one.
